/**
 * kitty.h - kitty graphics protocol emitter (single-header, stb-style)
 *
 * In exactly ONE .c file:
 *
 *     #define KITTY_IMPLEMENTATION
 *     #include "kitty.h"
 *
 * Images are transmitted once (kg_transmit) and then placed as many times as
 * needed. Placements are cheap; transmission is not. All commands carry q=2 so
 * the terminal stays silent - responses would otherwise land in term.h's input
 * queue and be decoded as keystrokes.
 *
 * Output goes through term.h's buffered writer, so call term_flush() to push a
 * frame out.
 *
 * TWO PLACEMENT STYLES
 *
 *   Unicode placeholders (kg_virtual_place + placeholder cells) are the default
 *   and the only style that works under tmux. The image is anchored to real
 *   text cells - U+10EEEE carrying the image id in its foreground color and
 *   row/column in combining diacritics - so a multiplexer or editor that knows
 *   nothing about graphics still moves, scrolls and redraws it correctly.
 *   Emitting the cells is the caller's job; screen.h does it via
 *   glyph_placeholder().
 *
 *   Direct placement (kg_place) puts the image at the cursor with optional
 *   sub-cell pixel offsets. Nothing tracks it, so tmux loses it on the first
 *   redraw. It buys pixel-exact positioning without cell-aligned padding.
 *
 *   Placeholders can match direct placement's precision: scale the image to
 *   exactly cols*cell_w by rows*cell_h and letterbox inside that buffer, which
 *   is what kg_fit_cells() computes.
 *
 * TMUX
 *
 *   Every graphics escape is an APC sequence tmux does not understand, so under
 *   tmux each one must be wrapped in a DCS passthrough with its ESCs doubled.
 *   kg_init() detects $TMUX and does this for you from then on. tmux also has
 *   to be told to allow it at all - see kg_tmux_allow_passthrough().
 *
 * IMAGE IDS
 *
 *   In placeholder mode the id travels in the cell's foreground color, so it
 *   must fit in 24 bits. Ids above that need a third diacritic carrying the
 *   high byte; kg_placeholder_cell() emits it, but staying under 2^24 keeps the
 *   encoding to two diacritics. Id 0 is not valid.

// below already bracket their own chunk loops; call these yourself only to
// batch several of them together.
//
// The wrapper is closed and reopened every KG_WRAP_MAX bytes. tmux discards a

// Ask the terminal itself, before any TUI setup: transmit a 1x1 image with a

// answers the second, which is what lets a negative answer be distinguished
// from a slow one. Puts stdin in raw mode for the duration and restores it.
//
// Call kg_init() first so the query is wrapped for tmux when needed.
//
// Under tmux the device attributes trick is skipped, because tmux answers that
// one itself, locally and immediately, while the graphics query still has to
// reach the outer terminal and come back - a race the local reply always wins,
// which would report every tmux pane as unsupported. So under tmux a terminal
// that stays silent yields -1 rather than 0, and the caller should fall back to
// kg_supported(). The cost is waiting out timeout_ms when there is no support.
//
// Returns 1 (supported), 0 (answered, but not supported), or -1 (no answer
// within timeout_ms, or stdin/stdout is not a terminal).
